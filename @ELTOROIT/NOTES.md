# Bookmarks files
- **bmCheck.txt** 
  - This file indicates what needs to be tested.
  - The way it's generated is by running the script and copying the bmDump.txt file and then making any necesary adjustments.
- **bmDump.txt** 
  - This file gets generated by the script everytime it runs with the results of the bookmarks processed. 
  - It's used for cofiguring the *bmCheck.txt* file
    - Same content
    - Different name
    - I do not want to override the original file everytime it runs so I create a different filename.
- **bmPretend.txt**
  - File for testing in Mac
  - Copy *bmDump.txt* to this file
  - This is the data that gets generated when the bookmarks are read from the borwsers. 
  - Because I write the code in a computer that is not the PCs to be tested (PCs are Windows and I write the code in Mac) I need to have the data so I can write the scripts. 
  - **THIS FILE SHOULD NOT EXIST WHEN TESTING THE MACHINES.**

How to create the bmCheck.txt from the bmDump.txt?
`cat ./_OriginalScripts/bmDump.txt | jq 'del(.[].urlChrome)' | jq 'del(.[].urlFirefox)' > ./_OriginalScripts/bmCheck.txt`
