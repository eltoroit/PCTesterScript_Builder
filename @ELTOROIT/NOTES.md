# Bookmarks files

-   **bmCheck.txt**
    -   This file indicates what needs to be tested.
    -   The way it's generated is by running the script and copying the bmDump.txt file and then making any necesary adjustments.
-   **bmDump.txt**
    -   This file gets generated by the script everytime it runs with the results of the bookmarks processed.
    -   It's used for cofiguring the _bmCheck.txt_ file
        -   Same content
        -   Different name
        -   I do not want to override the original file everytime it runs so I create a different filename.
-   **bmPretend.txt**
    -   File for testing in Mac
    -   Copy _bmDump.txt_ to this file
    -   This is the data that gets generated when the bookmarks are read from the borwsers.
    -   Because I write the code in a computer that is not the PCs to be tested (PCs are Windows and I write the code in Mac) I need to have the data so I can write the scripts.
    -   **THIS FILE SHOULD NOT EXIST WHEN TESTING THE MACHINES.**

# How to create the bmCheck.txt from the bmDump.txt?

```
cat ./_OriginalScripts/bmDump.json | jq 'del(.[].urlChrome)' | jq 'del(.[].urlFirefox)' > ./_OriginalScripts/bmCheck.json
```
