# New Notes

-   Updated for Dreamforce '22

## Steps

All the changes to the code are done in this folder, because the export script overrides the other repo folder!

### Mac

1. Create scratch org `./@ELTOROIT/scripts/shell/CreateOrg.sh`
2. Create new event record (https://flow-inspiration-27-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Event__c/list)
3. [optional] Clone actions from previous event by executing `./@ELTOROIT/scripts/Apex/CloneEvent.apex`
4. Create new actions if needed
5. Export data `./@ELTOROIT/scripts/ExportData.sh`
    - This exports the data using JSON for the script
    - Copies the files from `_OriginalScripts` to the parent folder
    - Commits and updates the repo in Github to be run in the machines being tested
    - Exports the data from the org using ETCopyData for backup
6. If you want to work with the bookmarks...
    - Once script runs on the testing machine, it creates one file with the bookmarks (bmDump.json).
    - Use that to generate (bmCheck.json) which is used to validate the bookmarks (see below for more information).
    - `cat ./_OriginalScripts/bmDump.json | jq 'del(.[].urlChrome)' | jq 'del(.[].urlFirefox)' > ./_OriginalScripts/bmCheck.json`

### VM

1. Ensure files are located at the correct locations
    1. C:\Users\Admin\t.bat
    2. C:\TH\test.bat
2. Execute normal operation
    1. Open CMD
    2. Type `t` and hit enter
3. Quick tests
    1. Execute normal operation
    2. Stop bt CTR+C
    3. run tt.bat
4. Execute in debug mode
    1. cd C:\TH\PCTesterScript>
    2. node --inspect-brk tester.js -test -run=1
5.

# OLd Notes

## TeamViewer

-   Update file: C:\TH\test.bat
-   Update file: C:\Users\Admin\t.bat

## Create Org

```
./@ELTOROIT/scripts/CreateOrg.sh
```

## Export data

```
./@ELTOROIT/scripts/ExportData.sh
```

## Bookmarks files

-   **bmCheck.txt**
    -   This file indicates what needs to be tested.
    -   The way it's generated is by running the script and copying the bmDump.txt file and then making any necesary adjustments.
-   **bmDump.txt**
    -   This file gets generated by the script everytime it runs with the results of the bookmarks processed.
    -   It's used for cofiguring the _bmCheck.txt_ file
        -   Same content
        -   Different name
        -   I do not want to override the original file everytime it runs so I create a different filename.
-   **bmPretend.txt**
    -   File for testing in Mac
    -   Copy _bmDump.txt_ to this file
    -   This is the data that gets generated when the bookmarks are read from the borwsers.
    -   Because I write the code in a computer that is not the PCs to be tested (PCs are Windows and I write the code in Mac) I need to have the data so I can write the scripts.
    -   **THIS FILE SHOULD NOT EXIST WHEN TESTING THE MACHINES.**

## How to create the bmCheck.txt from the bmDump.txt?

```
cat ./_OriginalScripts/bmDump.json | jq 'del(.[].urlChrome)' | jq 'del(.[].urlFirefox)' > ./_OriginalScripts/bmCheck.json
```
